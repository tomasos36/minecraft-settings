# Note: Smaller values result in less lag. Lift speed less than 0.4 may not work well for non spout servers.
# autoPlace will automatically move players to be fully in the elevator
# checkGlass will make sure all floors have glass blocks (at the cost of possible lag when starting a lift)
# preventEntry will prevent players from entering an active elevator (at the cost of possible lag when lifts are running)
